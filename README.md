TASK 1.1
Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
Basically the dataset had 4 features column named sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width with one classifcation column named as clas_ or species. THis mainly categories into 
Iris-setosa   
Iris-versicolor   
Iris-virginica 
The classification is done using Logistic Regression Algorithm with inbuilt scikit learn libraray. We have also splitted the dataset into training and testing set with ratio of 4:1.

TASK 1.4
Image to Pencil Sketch with Python
This is done using OpenCV where the original image is firstly converted into gray scale image, then blurred and finally Pencil sketch by inverting the blurred image.

TASK 2.1
Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism 
The visualisation is done using python where libraries used are Matplotlib, seaborn and Plotly. Dataset is firstly analyse on various columns, have dealed with null values so it has very less affect in the result. Finally using region based visualisaition and pie diagram to visualize the distribution of various factors such as weapontype, explosive,etc.

TASK 2.2
Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm 
This is same problem statement as 1.1 with the same dataset. We have used decision tree classifier algorithm to predict the classifcation and the accuracy on testing set turns out to be 100%.
